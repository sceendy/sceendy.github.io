      <p>When I interviewed for my current job a year ago, I already had another (higher) offer that I was seriously considering. Then, I met the team I would be working with at this company. One particular thing a lead engineer said stood out to me and may have even swayed me on considering the job.</p>
<blockquote>My worst day here is better than my best day at all the other places I've worked.</blockquote>

<p>There are so many offices with table tennis, drinks, snacks, and game nights - including this one - so I don’t particularly look for those things anymore. I find that things like trust within a company are much more valuable. Output is much more important than hours at the office. Working from home isn’t to do less work - it’s to focus on the work you have.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks into this job and I started to relate to the statement that the lead engineer made. Between the freedom I get with the projects I work on, the super talented engineers I get to work with, and the ridiculously nice people in the office – there are more than enough things that put this place above the rest.</p>

<p>As stoked as I am about this job, I’m not here to brag.</p>

<p>Just here to share some news and wanted to give a little background on why I love this company. Regardless of employer, I always enjoy the work - I wouldn’t do it if I didn’t.</p>

<blockquote>"If you don't absolutely love what you do with a true passion, then what's the point in doing it at all?" - Joan Callamezzo</blockquote>
<p>However, this is the first company I can say I really <strong>love</strong> working for.</p>

<h4>Perks</h4>
<p>First bit of news is: next month, I start working from home. This is not necessarily new for me, I became a remote worker for my last job after a year too. However, I still consider this a very nice perk since plenty of companies still won’t allow it – pft.</p>

<p>Also, this time I am not doing it to get away from a terrible office culture like at my last job. It is actually due to the second bit of news.</p>

<h4>Relocation</h4>
<p><strong>I’m moving to Austin</strong>. Yep. I’m too fond of Texas to ever leave the state but I do want to venture out of the DFW area where I have been spent my whole life. Austin has a tad bit more to offer in terms of providing the best of both worlds when it comes to nature and city-living which is something I definitely want to experience.</p>
