      <p>For most of this year, I have been focused on improving my technical skills. No complaints; I love building single page applications. On the other hand, there have been times where I reach for a pencil and start to sketch.
<br /><br />
My first job ever was a development/design position with a much greater emphasis on designing for print: flyers, posters, shirts, etc. I never thought much about my process or workflow, though. I would receive an assignment - often a poster for an event - and look at previous designs for the same event since most of the events were annual. Some would be pretty basic such as one graphic, a patterned background, and the necessary text. Others would have incredible details such as vector graphics and custom typography. I enjoyed looking through the variety as it was a student position so turnover was quick which left a range of previous work. Looking for inspiration? Well, upon reflection, I suppose I was looking for direction and would take my own lead from there.
<br /><br />
Now, though, I don’t do as much designing as I used to. Sure, I contribute to design like I did at Joinem… but more often than not, I stick to consulting by choice. I respect designers and their ability to create beautiful things from nothing. At Joinem, I felt like more of a lighthouse since we had various people touching the designs with no styleguide. I highly discourage that, by the way. <b>There is such a thing as too many cooks in a kitchen and sometimes they aren’t all cooks. </b>
<br /><br />
I felt compelled to create a dynamic styleguide for the team after a couple months of receiving a bunch of different font sizes and styles from freelance designers but rarely had the time to add to it. I was focused on the client-side code; so, there you have it, an important aspect of a website was a frontend developers’ side-project that was on the back-burner. How unfortunate. No, I don’t think that a styleguide would have solved all of our problems. It could have prevented a substantial amount and saved so much time/efforts, though.
<br /><br />
Anyway, these days, I have the time to reengage with my creative side. A year ago, I bought a house with my boyfriend. A few months into it, I bought these blank cardboard-looking cards that I thought would be nice to design on. Eventually, I found a great use for them: invitations! They were a good 3.5 x 5.5 inches but figured I could make it work.</p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>Since these are invitations for my own events, I first write down the information that is needed such as location, time, date, etc. Then, I use that to begin the layout. The cards are relatively small so I aim to make the best use of the space. Luckily, they’re double sided so really one side can have all the <i>needed</i> information and the other side can be the “fun” part for me. Once I have the layout, I continue on with the other aspects of the design.
<br /><br />
I am incredibly picky about colors. These cards were a bit limiting in a way because they are quite dark. It kind of narrowed the scope for color. So, I started by visiting dribbble and looking at <a href="https://dribbble.com/search?q=brown">color palettes that had been used with brown</a> (the color of the cards). I generally had a theme in my mind for the event itself but I had to determine if it needed to be lightened or darkened to look good on the card itself. A dark gray is always a beautiful color for text and it’d be pretty powerful on a brownish background so I chose it for my main text color. Light shades of red and blue worked well for large text (titles) and graphics.
