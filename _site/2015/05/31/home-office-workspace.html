      <div class="blog-text"><p>Whenever people ask what it is like to work from home, they often want to know what I have in my home office. I like to think I keep it pretty simple but once I am done listing all the items, I feel that it may not be <i>too</i> simple.<br />
<br />
 </p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vaDLqj6ZlOs/VXHeGAKE6dI/AAAAAAAAHZ8/MOMhq818sZ0/s1600/IMG_20150605_122800.jpg" /><br />
<br />
 Obviously, the number one item is my Macbook. My Macbook setup is pretty low-key, I’d say:
<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Terminal</li>
<li>Atom</li>
<li>Chrome browser (Jira, local environment)</li>
<li>Mail app</li>
<li>Hipchat</li>
</ul>
<p>I get all my coding done on this machine. I have Photoshop but rarely find myself using it – designing in the browser is my preference.<br />
<br />
 </p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m203p0ZLHCE/VXHiGW5rqdI/AAAAAAAAHaU/XLEYQRnUG7M/s1600/IMG_20150605_122440.jpg" /><br />
<br />
 My Chromebook is my personal machine so I keep it pretty chill.
<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Spotify</li>
<li>personal Gmail</li>
<li>Leisure Web Browsing
<ul>
<li>Reddit (r/webdev, r/frontend, r/design_critiques)</li>
<li>Smashing Magazine</li>
<li>Codepen</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Twitch.tv</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Netflix</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve gotten into watching live coding on Twitch (shout out to flip4bytes &amp; syntag) so if they’re streaming, I connect my Chromebook to Chromecast on my TV (not pictured – but the remote is next to my apple) while I’m working. I don’t like it being dead silent in here so that certainly helps with that. My Sony bluetooth headphones are also kept here but typically only used if I go into the office downtown.</p>

<p>Yes, my Xbox is in my office. Unfortunately, it rarely gets used these days. I used to play it during my lunch time or after work but I’ve been too busy. (Game of preference: Halo Reach)<br />
<br />
 </p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N8X20Y3BGDY/VXHiM-cj4AI/AAAAAAAAHac/ikfTYxrBE-c/s1600/IMG_20150605_122459.jpg" /><br />
<br />
 I have a few notepads (typically used for lists), post-its (quick notes about a task), and Moleskine notebooks (for sketching). I have pencils but mostly use my Precise V5 - Extra Fine pens. I also have my whiteboard for when I really need to get a lot written down. This is incredibly nice to have when I am building a feature that contains smaller features that need to be spec’d out.<br />
<br />
A few flash drives are kept in case I need to transfer anything but they don’t go used much anymore with the cloud and all. I have an external hard drive that I use for backing up important things but that’s about the only one that gets any love now.<br />
<br />
Oh… and that’s Mexican pesos… I kept forgetting where I placed it and decided to leave it in plain sight. I am going to Mexico in a couple weeks and definitely don’t want to lose it again!<br />
<br /></p>
<div style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
Books are definitely a must-have. I keep my favorite books and even a few comic books in the bookshelf attached below my desk. There is always a point during the week where I just feel like reading some fun Javascript writing assignment in "If Hemingway Wrote Javascript" or open up "Don't Make Me Think"/"Universal Principles of Design" to revisit some examples in those books. &nbsp;Getting away from screens can be very relaxing!</div>
<p>I have the Polaroid box here, too, since that is where I keep the charger and don’t like to misplace it. I guess if you look close enough, you’ll see random objets such as a business card box, Yahtzee - Mario edition, ET dressed up, and a box that has a bunch of extra pens.<br />
<br />
If you guys have any questions about anything, feel free to ask. I am also looking to buy a new desk too so any recommendations are welcome as well!</p>
