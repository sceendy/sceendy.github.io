    <p class="summary">As someone born in 1990, I have always used the years divisible by 5 as checkpoints of my life. I think it started out as an easy way to keep track of my age or something trivial like that. Nevertheless, I use it as a time to evaluate myself and the things I have accomplished but more importantly, plan for the future. Not to say that I don’t do that as deemed necessary by myself...</p>

    <h4>Messing around with the Tumblr API</h4>
    <time class="small">Dec 17, 2014</time>
    <p class="summary">In order to avoid managing a blog myself, I wanted to try out handling my blogging with the Tumblr API. I figured it’d be easier to keep up with and leave out any complexity from integrating a blog onto my actual site. It’s easier just to hit up some API endpoints with ngResource since I’m using Angular. This was actually the first time I set up a site to reach out to some API endpoints...</p>

    <p class="summary">My last job was at an agency - pretty standard front-end tasks and projects. We supported IE8+ since we had some pretty big client with thousands of page views a day with half of the traffic mostly coming from IE8 and IE9. Agencies typically prefer to support as many browsers as possible. One client in particular had us support as far back as IE6, though. They had a decent amount of hits coming from outside...</p>

    <h4>Day in the Life of a Frontend Developer</h4>
    <time class="small">Oct 16, 2014</time>
    <p class="summary">Let me start out by saying that, yes, I did get this idea from the other frontend dev blogs that I browse. I saw a wave of talented front-end web developers blog about what a day in their life is like. It really got me thinking about how we could all be doing the same job (more or less) but manage to have different daily routines. Some developers work remotely daily or once a week,...</p>

    <h4>Front Porch Frontend Conference</h4>
    <time class="small">Oct 8, 2014</time>
    <p class="summary">After months of not going to any kind of developer gathering, I attended the FrontPorch, a frontend web developer conference at the Granada Theater. Among topics covered were some that fairly interested me including Sass (metholodgy), best practices for SVG, deploying with Capistrano, and Node. 

Check it out, www.frontporch.io.
