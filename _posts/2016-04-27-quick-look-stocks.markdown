Recently, I have developed an interest in economics and finance.

This new found interest has led me to pick up the d3.js library to generate charts based on user input with a focus on personal finance and budgeting. However, I really wanted to design/build a 'quick look at stocks' widget for myself as well. I opened up CodePen and threw together a quick prototype.

I created a super simple user interface that allows users to select from a list of companies to check their low/high stock value for the day along with the current value.
