This past weeks' coding challenge was a CSS challenge, really. DevWars has a weekly live coding competition with two different types of battles. One is called Zen Garden - it's a 1v1 where developers get the same prewritten HTML and have to style it. I've seen the battle go down a few times now and it looks like so much fun. <br/><br/>
<b>A few couple for the battle:</b> you can't touch the HTML, you have one hour.<br/><br/>
I decided I could go by the same rules to see how well I do with those limitations.<br/><br/>

I did not touch the HTML and styled up as much as possible in an hour. I added a couple media queries but mostly because I had the <i>results</i> tab smaller while writing up my Sass. Thoughts?
