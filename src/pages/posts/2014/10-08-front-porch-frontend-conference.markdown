<p>After months of not going to any kind of developer gathering, I attended the FrontPorch conference which is a frontend web developer conference at the Granada Theater. Among topics covered were some that fairly interested me including SMACSS (metholodgy), best practices for SVG, deploying with Capistrano, and Node. </p>
