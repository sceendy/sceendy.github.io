Over the past couple of years, I have started reading books only to abandon them a few chapters in. It's not for lack of interest, either. Other stuff always comes up and before I know it, I have another book in hand and the cycle continues. 

This year, I've decided to fix that. No more new books until I finish these 7. 

Luckily, I made it about halfway through for most of them but I figured throwing the list on here would help keep me accountable.
