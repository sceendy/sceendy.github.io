Over the past couple of years, I have started reading books only to abandon them a few chapters in. It's not for lack of interest, either. Other stuff always comes up and before I know it, I have another book in hand and the cycle continues. ~~This year, I've decided to fix that. No more new books until I finish these 7.~~

I made it about halfway through these but I figured throwing the list on here would help keep me accountable.
