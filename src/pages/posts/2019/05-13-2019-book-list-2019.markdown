A year ago, I posted my book list for 2018. I started out with 7 books and by the end of the year the list had grown to 11 despite my best efforts. In the end, I finished 8 out of those 11 books which felt pretty good. 

This year, I'm committed to keeping the list manageable. I'm pulling in the 3 books I didn't finish last year along with some new ones.

* **Essentialism** by Greg Mckeown
* **Becoming** by Michelle Obama
* **The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World** by Melinda Gates
* **It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work** by Jason Fried
* **JavaScript for Web Developers** by Nicholas C. Zakas
* **Fear and Loathing On The Campaign Trail '72** by Hunter S. Thompson
* **The Design of Everyday Things** by Don Norman
* **A Clash of Kings** by George R.R. Martin
