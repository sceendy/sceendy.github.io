So, it's been a minute.

My previous post was January 18th, 2023 - at the time, I was excited to be joining a new team after being on the same feature team for 5 years. Now, here I am nearly 2 years later ready to report back.

At this point, we've knocked out 200+ accessibility defects, added several new reusable/accessible components, improved most of the existing components, did a lot of fine-tuning under the hood, and overall made our component library so much easier to utilize for both Aetna **and** CVS teams. Along the way, we had engineers join the team for a quarter or two to help level them up as well.

I had been on this design system/component library team up until this last quarter of 2024. AFAIK, I'm only temporarily pitching in on a feature team for half of Q4. 

Up until this little recent change, I had been pretty happy on my new team. Not as many existential crises - didn't get down to zero but less is less.

 Unfortunately, my favorite manager did end up joining a different team in a different role last quarter but you know, the team culture and overall vibes persist which is something to be grateful about. Otherwise, it's been a relatively autonomous team which is a nice change of pace for me. I was able to prioritize fixing things that I had noticed but not had time to fix while on a feature team. 

 Being on a feature team for the past few sprints did allow me to realize where my other team could be doing better, though! So, I'm looking forward to going back and being able to apply some improvements based on my observations. Looking at even reworking a component I had just published a couple of months ago! Stoked :)
