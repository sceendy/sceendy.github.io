{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I started out this year unemployed and depressed. I quit my job in August of 2017 and took several months off to take some trips and figure out what I wanted out of my next job. </p>\n<p>As I worked through my depression and felt the helplessness lift off my shoulders, I started to feel very motivated to find my next challenge. I had always worked for small companies and while working through my depression, I realized that a big source of stress of me had been that I would often end up feeling like I had no one to reach out at work when overwhelmed or feeling stuck. I'm the one that gets stuff done and usually quickly -- they knew it and I encouraged that idea. This led to me being placed in a lot of high pressure situations where I felt I had no one to turn to. </p>\n<p>So, in January 2018, I decided I needed to prioritize my mental health more in my next position. It needed to be a product I'd be passionate about so that I can look forward to contributing to it even when the pressure is on. I would need it to be 100% remote as I am not a fan of small-talk at the office or the DFW commute.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"2018 in review","date":"December 26, 2018","tags":["personal"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"blog/2018/12-26-bring-on-2019/","date":"2018-12-26T14:30:00.000Z"}}
