In that time, I've seen how creating web applications for <em>everyone</em> should be important to all devs. As devs, we can all strive do our part in building with accessibility as part of our normal workflow.</p>\n<h3>Write Semantic HTML</h3>\n<p>I see far too many <code class=\"language-text\">div</code>'s these days. If you use them a lot -- don't worry, I've seen plenty of junior to senior+ front-end engineers do the same. There are some pretty common places where you can start swapping them out.</p>\n<p>Example: If it reads like a list (perhaps iterating over an array using the <code class=\"language-text\">map</code> method), you should likely use the tag or role:<code class=\"language-text\">ul</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">ol</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">role=list</code> (<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/List_role\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Read more about the list role on the Mozilla Developer Network\">read more</a>). I am not particularly a fan of using the role for this example but maybe you can't change the HTML for some reason and can only append attributes to existing elements. It's definitely better than nothing.</p>\n<p>Review <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the list of HTML elements</a> - read through their descriptions and swap out your <code class=\"language-text\">div</code> tags today. Structural/semantic HTML is THE starting point for accessibility because assistive devices rely on the DOM.</p>\n<p>Write your HTML first - this makes you think about the structure from the start.</p>\n<p>Test your semantic HTML by disabling CSS - does your content still look organized and read as you intend it to?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Firefox</strong>: View > Page Style > No Style</li>\n<li><strong>IE 11</strong>: View > Style > No Style</li>\n<li><strong>Chrome</strong>: Use a browser extension like <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh/related?hl=en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wave</a>; toggle \"Styles\" off</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*React tip: you can use Fragments to help group your content without adding extra nodes to the DOM.</p>\n<h3>Tab around</h3>\n<p>Test your web page without a mouse. Users should be able to access all the interactive elements you need them to by using their keyboard. Interactive elements such as input fields and buttons will receive focus by default. Other elements such as <code class=\"language-text\">div</code>s usually don't need to be interacted with. However, if you need to bring focus or have a non-interactive element be tabbale, you may consider adding the <code class=\"language-text\">tabindex</code> attribute to your element or using <code class=\"language-text\">focus()</code> in your JS.</p>\n<p>The order in which your items are accessibile depends on the DOM order. You can change the order using <code class=\"language-text\">tabindex</code>.</p>\n<h3>Be considerate with dynamic content</h3>\n<p>Aside from using the <code class=\"language-text\">focus</code> method to set focus to elements manually, you can also ensure your dynamic content makes use of roles such as <code class=\"language-text\">status</code> and the <code class=\"language-text\">aria-live</code> attribute. </p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">aria-live</code> attribute has three values, <code class=\"language-text\">polite</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">assertive</code>, or <code class=\"language-text\">off</code> (off is the default.) An example would be if you have a list of items that can be filtered by the user. The container for that list should have <code class=\"language-text\">aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;</code> so that when the list items update based on the filter, the update is announced when the user pauses. I personally haven't really felt the need to set it to <code class=\"language-text\">assertive</code> since that interrupts all other announcements.</p>\n<p>Similarily, you have roles like <code class=\"language-text\">status</code> which works like a \"polite\" live region and <code class=\"language-text\">alert</code> which works like an \"assertive\" live region. For example, the status role could be used to notify a user that a change has been saved. You may use the alert role is used to announce critical information such as an error that needs immediate attention.</p>\n<h3>Use browser tools and extensions</h3>\n<p>Most browsers now have Accessibility tools built right into their devtools. They can show you the color contrast, tab order or check for other common issues. There are two extensions/add-ons that I've enjoyed using in my development flow that tell you how to fix issues as well:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Axe browser extension</a> - This one adds a tab to your browser devtools.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wave.webaim.org/extension/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WAVE</a> - This tool renders on the left side of your browser.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3>Stuff to check out</h3>\n<p>For much more in-depth explanations and examples, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_ex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this W3C document</a> covers A LOT.</p>\n<p>There's a <a href=\"https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">checklist</a> created by the A11y Project.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Front-end Friday: Accessibility Tips","date":"March 12, 2021","tags":["ui","dev","a11y"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"blog/2021/03-12-front-end-friday-accessibility/","date":"2021-03-12T18:00:00.000Z"}}}
