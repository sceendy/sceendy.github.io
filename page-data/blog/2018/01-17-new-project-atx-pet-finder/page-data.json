That's when I stumbled upon this page: <a href=\"https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Found-Pets-Map/hye6-gvq2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Austin Animal Center Found Pets Map</a>, screenshot below.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rbZTkyz.png\" title=\"official austin animal center\"/>\n</p>\n<p>When you first land on that page, you might find the design a bit underwhelming... especially if you're a designer. Despite it having filtering functionality, you may have missed it on first glance which is unfortunate because it allows for plenty options to narrow your search.</p>\n<h4>How would I use it if I lost my dog today?</h4>\n<p>I decided to see what I could do to make the filtering a bit less of an afterthought. For that, I can focus on the most likely user scenario: I just lost my dog, I don't really need to see a list of over 100 dogs and cats, right? I just want to see dogs. Next, my dog is an intact male.</p>\n<p>Cool, that brings the search results down from 146 to 35. That's much less overwhelming which is a welcome feeling if I'm likely already particularly emotional.</p>\n<h4>Using the map</h4>\n<p>I wanted the map to have all the markers on it but only show a few pets in the list at a time. I suppose I could make the markers stand out based on the 4 pets being listed at that time but that doesn't seem as helpful right now. I added some pagination to allow the user to cycle through the list, though.</p>\n<p>While I know my dog could have wandered off from where I thought I lost him, I'd want to narrow down the scope of the area too. Once I zoom into that area, I want to be able to click on a marker to isolate the dog found in that location.</p>\n<h4>The pet list</h4>\n<p>Each pet card in the list shows information about a pet and in an order that felt pretty natural. A picture, the possible breed and the date/location where it was found would be good to know right away. The rest of the details in the data are essentially just tag type of information.</p>\n<p>I thought some colorful, cute looking <a href=\"https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/1293-animal-icons-sketch-freebie-resource.html\" alt=\"cute animal icon set\" rel=\"noopener\">icons</a> would serve as better map markers but thought they wouldn't stand out that well on the standard Google Maps theme. Using JSON, I changed the Map theme to look more like grayscale to fix that. </p>\n<p>With those things in mind, I rebuilt the tool in a way that I thought would be more helpful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/d3Zp1CL.png\" title=\"ATX Paw Finder\" /></p>\n<p class=\"u--text-center\">\nbuilt using angular, bulma, google maps api, austin open data<br/>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/sceendy/atx-paw-finder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Repo</a> | <a href=\"https://sceendy.com/atx-paw-finder/\">Live Site</a>\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New project: ATX Paw Finder","date":"January 17, 2018","tags":["dev","news","projects"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"blog/2018/01-17-new-project-atx-pet-finder/","date":"2018-01-17T17:10:00.000Z"}}}
