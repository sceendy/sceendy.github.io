I really wanted to get into more music so I created some tripod site with a template that had widgets for sh*t like a guest book to get punk band recommendations. ðŸ˜‚</p>\n<p>Then, I got into skateboarding and created a new tripod site to try to start a skateboarding club to put a skate video together with local skaters. Later, we connected on myspace and became friends IRL. Without any more motivation to create tripod sites (everyone was on myspace), I moved onto creating custom myspace layouts for friends. I am still pretty proud of them and even got paid for some around 2008/2009. The timing for that was sort of funny because FB overtook myspace in popularity like two months later.</p>\n<p>By then, I had taken a computer science (java) class and 2 web design classes in high school to write somewhat cleaner markup/css and think of more complex programming stuff. I enjoyed getting better and uh, well, here I am.</p>\n<p>dude, shout out to other services around at that time:\nputfile, garageband, AIM</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"how i got started","date":"April 15, 2022","tags":["dev"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"blog/2022/04-15-how-i-got-started/","date":"2022-04-15T16:00:00.000Z"}},
