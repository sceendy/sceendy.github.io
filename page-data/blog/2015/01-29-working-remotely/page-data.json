I can definitely appreciate the opportunity my current job has given me to work from home - even one day a week is beneficial.Â </p>\n<br />\n<br />\nWhile I will credit my knowledge in communicating online to the many courses/profeesors I took while in the Emerging Media and Communications program at UT-Dallas, I think putting it into practice really solidified my approach. With a relatively small development team, it's important to be connected in some way. Whether it's HipChat, Hangouts, or just plain email, it's pretty easy to be just a keystroke away from everything I need to complete a task. Or when needed, Screenhero and Remote Desktop (Google) have been quite helpful to say the least.<br />\n<br />\nLike most startups, we do have schedule meetings that help us with this as well. A daily standup meeting, a Monday Dev Meeting, and scheduled meetings with other departments here and there. Part of the reason it has been successful, I'd definitely credit to those meetings. We use them as a way to know what we are each doing and discuss anything we may need help on or have a question about.<br />\n<br />\nUpon reflection, even when I am in the office, it feels remote at times because some other developer could be working from home so there's still the physical distance. Thus, online communication is crucial whether I am in the office or not. I personally believe that it improves even without conscious effort but conscious effort will definitely make a bigger difference in a shorter amount of time.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Working remotely\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OnwG1ZIqthU/VMq6Us0mC3I/AAAAAAAAFHE/3NCgQW6BI9E/s1600/remote-desk.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" /><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\n<img align=\"left\" alt=\"List of things to-do\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kpdd8P9uhU4/VMrEx7cDvqI/AAAAAAAAFHo/O7gRRSHmqxo/s1600/IMAG3300.jpg\" style=\"margin-right: 30px;\" title=\"\" width=\"276\" /></div>\nAnother important aspect of remote working would be time management. Distractions are everywhere regardless of where you work. Whether I go to the Starbucks a mile away or sit in my home office, I line to use a short list of tasks that I want to complete that day with me. <br />\n<br />\nIt helps a lot to have that hanging over my head... or well, on post-it sticking to my laptop. While I prefer focusing on tasks for a couple of hours at a time, I also have started working some things in to take a short break. For example, today I worked in my home office for a little bit for my initial meetings, then I moved into my backyard. There's something about being outside that feels a bit more inspirational. After working on a couple tasks, I got dressed to go for a jog to a near by grocery store. Upon my return, I took a shower and got ready for another call. Since then, I have been working on tasks - making sure my HipChat notification count goes back to \"0\" quickly.<br />\n<br />\nAt this point, my process feels like a well-oiled machine -- but it definitely took some time; mistakes were made but I learned from them. Working remotely is an extraordinary capability for any team to have at any stage of development.","frontmatter":{"title":"Working Remotely","date":"January 29, 2015","tags":["remote"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"blog/2015/01-29-working-remotely/","date":"2015-01-29T17:45:30.000Z"}}}
