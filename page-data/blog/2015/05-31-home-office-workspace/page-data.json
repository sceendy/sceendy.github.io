I like to think I keep it pretty simple but once I am done listing all the items, I feel that it may not be <i>too</i> simple.<br />\n<br />\n </p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vaDLqj6ZlOs/VXHeGAKE6dI/AAAAAAAAHZ8/MOMhq818sZ0/s1600/IMG_20150605_122800.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\n Obviously, the number one item is my Macbook. My Macbook setup is pretty low-key, I'd say:\n<br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terminal</li>\n<li>Atom</li>\n<li>Chrome browser (Jira, local environment)</li>\n<li>Mail app</li>\n<li>Hipchat</li>\n</ul>\nI get all my coding done on this machine. I have Photoshop but rarely find myself using it -- designing in the browser is my preference.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m203p0ZLHCE/VXHiGW5rqdI/AAAAAAAAHaU/XLEYQRnUG7M/s1600/IMG_20150605_122440.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\n My Chromebook is my personal machine so I keep it pretty chill.\n<br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spotify</li>\n<li>personal Gmail</li>\n<li>Leisure Web Browsing\n<ul>\n<li>Reddit (r/webdev, r/frontend, r/design_critiques)</li>\n<li>Smashing Magazine</li>\n<li>Codepen</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Twitch.tv</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Netflix</li>\n</ul>\nI've gotten into watching live coding on Twitch (shout out to flip4bytes &amp; syntag) so if they're streaming, I connect my Chromebook to Chromecast on my TV (not pictured -- but the remote is next to my apple) while I'm working. I don't like it being dead silent in here so that certainly helps with that. My Sony bluetooth headphones are also kept here but typically only used if I go into the office downtown.\n<style> img {max-width: 100%;}</style>\nYes, my Xbox is in my office. Unfortunately, it rarely gets used these days. I used to play it during my lunch time or after work but I've been too busy. (Game of preference: Halo Reach)<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;\n<p><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N8X20Y3BGDY/VXHiM-cj4AI/AAAAAAAAHac/ikfTYxrBE-c/s1600/IMG_20150605_122459.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\n I have a few notepads (typically used for lists), post-its (quick notes about a task), and Moleskine notebooks (for sketching). I have pencils but mostly use my Precise V5 - Extra Fine pens. I also have my whiteboard for when I really need to get a lot written down. This is incredibly nice to have when I am building a feature that contains smaller features that need to be spec'd out.<br />\n<br />\nA few flash drives are kept in case I need to transfer anything but they don't go used much anymore with the cloud and all. I have an external hard drive that I use for backing up important things but that's about the only one that gets any love now.<br />\n<br />\nOh... and that's Mexican pesos... I kept forgetting where I placed it and decided to leave it in plain sight. I am going to Mexico in a couple weeks and definitely don't want to lose it again!<br />\n<br /></p>\n<div style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\">\nBooks are definitely a must-have. I keep my favorite books and even a few comic books in the bookshelf attached below my desk. There is always a point during the week where I just feel like reading some fun Javascript writing assignment in \"If Hemingway Wrote Javascript\" or open up \"Don't Make Me Think\"/\"Universal Principles of Design\" to revisit some examples in those books. &nbsp;Getting away from screens can be very relaxing!</div>\nI have the Polaroid box here, too, since that is where I keep the charger and don't like to misplace it. I guess if you look close enough, you'll see random objets such as a business card box, Yahtzee - Mario edition, ET dressed up, and a box that has a bunch of extra pens.<br />\n<br />\nIf you guys have any questions about anything, feel free to ask. I am also looking to buy a new desk too so any recommendations are welcome as well!","frontmatter":{"title":"Home Office Workspace","date":"May 31, 2015","tags":["remote"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"blog/2015/05-31-home-office-workspace/","date":"2015-05-31T13:12:30.000Z"}}}
