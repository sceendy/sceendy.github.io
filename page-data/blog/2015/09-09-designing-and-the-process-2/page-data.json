Layout is typically where I sometimes struggle for print, honestly. I don't like adding content for the sake of filling space and I want the layout to help with the hierarchy of content.</p>\n<h3>Design - Cover</h3>\nFor example, I looked around at different infographics. I've seen plenty of them and the items are often in their own space. I opened up Sketch, set the size, and began adding elements. My first graphic to create was the main one on the front - a house built with just rectangles (very minimalistic.) A banner for the heading felt appropriate - it makes me think \"festive announcement.\" Once I had the text done, I began to create the custom icons. I already knew what would be served: margaritas, beer, and pork. Those three things have some very recognizable graphics to represent them, luckily. Sketch allows you to make them into reusable symbols which is perfect.\n<br/><br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lwBOhMNcMpg/VfBDSdIE_ZI/AAAAAAAAJvQ/X_SpGaSo458/s800/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-09%2Bat%2B9.32.57%2BAM.png\" /></div>\n<br/><br/>\n(Yeah, I got lazy with the naming...)<br/>\nOnce the icons were made, and I finished the cover, I was inspired for the back part of the invitation. Clean, thin lines for borders. Continued use of the theme colors for the rest of the icons. Lovely.\n<br/><br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3qwO-4wlnac/VfBBw6rIExI/AAAAAAAAJvE/t9LCYcUQ_P4/s800/front-public.png\" /></div>\n<h3>Design - Back</h3>\nIn order to continue on with simple, thin-bordered rectangles, I decided to use them to divide the content for the back. I used a serif font for descriptive text which I barely used since most of them did not need descriptions. The sans-serif font was used for the information itself and the numbers were made a bit heavier that the regular text. The decorative font was really just used for the word \"anniversary\" for the cover but I found another use for it: our names. It didn't make sense for either the sans-serif and serif fonts to be used for our names so using the display text was more of a \"let's see if this works\" approach. Glad it worked out.\n<br/><br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RtNw-j_XtD4/Ve8Z3JT6dUI/AAAAAAAAJuM/CcjDOxBzg3Y/s800/invitation-back-design.png\" /></div>\n<br/><br/>\n<b><small>This is part two of a two part entry.</small></b>","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing and the process #2","date":"September 09, 2015","tags":["design","personal"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"blog/2015/09-09-designing-and-the-process-2/","date":"2015-09-09T09:42:02.000Z"}}}
