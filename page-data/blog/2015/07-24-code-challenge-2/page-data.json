Interesting and plenty of potential, honestly. However, I decided to find a design on dribbble myself and see how I could modify it a bit.\n<br/><br/>\nI wanted this component to be similar to the Week 2 challenge so I found a <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/876515-Search-for-friends-list/attachments/94290\">contact list</a>. I do think it looks good as it is but I changed the colors and removed a couple things. I also added AngularJS to get a little functionality in. As of this blog post, you can add a new athlete to the list but obviously not store it. I will be adding lists to each category but don't intend on storing any data. This is just a fun widget.\n<br/><br/></p>\n<iframe height='685' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/sceendy/embed/GJXEEx/?height=685&theme-id=11022&default-tab=result' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/sceendy/pen/GJXEEx/'>Contact List</a> by Cindy Juarez (<a href='http://codepen.io/sceendy'>@sceendy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n<br/><br/>\nI grabbed some quick stats from the Dallas Mavericks team to be displayed and the logo is a default image for the athlete. I definitely used flexbox for the layout as I felt it accomplished things very nicely.\n<br/><br/>\n<i><b>The goal is to only spend 1-2 hours on these.</b></i>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Challenge #2","date":"July 24, 2015","tags":["angular","sass","personal"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"blog/2015/07-24-code-challenge-2/","date":"2015-07-24T14:49:30.000Z"}},
