I have found myself learning tidbits here and there that have been really helpful. It's also generally fun to be able to help when the developer is stumped.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite users is Syntag - a frontend developer that has his own agency and codes a few hours at a time for Twitch. Through his channel, I found <a href=\"http://www.devwars.tv\">DevWars</a> - \"the ultimate developers battleground.\" They recently started weekly challenges where people code out components. The first one was a music player design from Dribble.\n<br/><br/></p>\n<iframe height='421' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/sceendy/embed/MwVzYb/?height=421&theme-id=11022&default-tab=result' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/sceendy/pen/MwVzYb/'>Implementation of a Design</a> by Cindy Juarez (<a href='http://codepen.io/sceendy'>@sceendy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n<br/><br/>\nI had fun writing up the HTML/Sass and even challenged myself to write it in under 2 hours. While the coding challenge page included a spritesheet with the icons to use, I really like the Google Material icons so I found icons that represented the same thing from the sprite sheet and used those instead. I grabbed a song I liked and found a quick 30 second snippet of the song to play. You can play/pause the song as of now - I used jQuery to add the &lt;audio&gt; element and then set the attributes for it. The play/pause is controlled by an if/else statement. That was my only goal for it initially as I'm working on a ReactJS project but I will get back to it and complete it this week.\n<br/></br>\n<i><strong>Todos:</strong>\n<br/><strike>get the progress bar to work while the song is playing</strike>\n<br/>change to previous song and to next song of an array\n<br/>add sharing which will just be something like a tweet that says, 'Currently playing: {{ songName }} by {{ artist }} on Codepen'. </i>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Challenge #1","date":"July 20, 2015","tags":["jquery","sass"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"blog/2015/07-20-code-challenge-1/","date":"2015-07-20T13:14:30.000Z"}}}
