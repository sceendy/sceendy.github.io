I wanted to just replicate layouts I had seen on other websites. Like any other teenager, I became pretty active on Myspace. I noticed most of my friends started customizing their Myspace layouts and most of the them came with a link back to the site where the layout came from. I would look around for one I liked but it never really felt right with any. So, I decided I'd find the one closest to what I want and just modify it. <br />\n<br />\nWhile I reflect on how I got started with markup, I think the only reason I really stuck to it was to solve that initial problem of not finding the right Myspace layout. As it turns out, a few of my friends were not that satisfied with theirs either which led to my first freelance gigs. As I continued to get requests, I would learn more and more to continue being able to provide the demand. One friend in particular would constantly challenge me with new questions... a layout that rearranged nearly every component or add different interactions. Oh, and you know... him constantly changing his mind.<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img alt=\"Harden blocked by Aminu\" src=\"https://giant.gfycat.com/DefensiveMelodicHippopotamus.gif\" />\n</div>\n<br />\nFor me, web development is still all about solving problems. I've gotten past just writing markup and continue to expand my skill set to allow for solving those problems in a more efficient and clean way, though. And I'd like to think that leveling up as a developer all began with those first lines of JavaScript.","frontmatter":{"title":"I'm a problem solver","date":"March 24, 2015","tags":["javascript","personal"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"blog/2015/01-29-im-a-problem-solver/","date":"2015-03-24T16:39:30.000Z"}}}
