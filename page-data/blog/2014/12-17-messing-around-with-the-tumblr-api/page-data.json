I figured it'd be easier to keep up with and leave out any complexity from integrating a blog onto my actual site. It's easier just to hit up some API endpoints with ngResource since I'm using Angular.<br />\n<br />\nThis was actually the first time I set up a site to reach out to some API endpoints so I thought I could write a little about my experience.<br />\nTumblr's API documentation is quite simple to understand and allowed for me to get it all hooked up within an hour. I got an OAuth Key and then used Angulars' ngResource to point to their API and get it to return the JSON.<br />\n<code>var url = \"<a href=\"http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/%22+\">http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/\"+</a> blog<em>url + \"/posts/text?api</em>key=\" + api<em>key + '&#x26;limit=20';</code><br />\nI placed made the blog</em>url and api<em>key variables for better visibility and I am not sure if I will keep the URL of the Tumblr I have had since 2009. At the end of the line, I limited the amount of posts to grab to 20 for now to see how I like it. Of course, on the front-end of the home page, I limitTo 4 posts and on the archive page I let it reach the limit set in the URL.<br />\n<br />\nOnce I got that setup, I decide to make a little test in the console to make sure all was well.<br />\n<code></em>resource.test(function(data, $sce){ console.log('Tumblr status = '+ data.meta.status + ', msg = ' + data.meta.msg + ' for ' + data.response.blog.title);</code><br />\nWhich then returned the following:<br />\n<img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/a0eb63c50643de3c12acdd599b86d9fe/tumblr_inline_ngl2qsOSMD1qzntgb.png\" /><br />\nFantastic! That meant I was good to go ahead and call in some of the data.<br />\n<strong>index.js:</strong><br /></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">$scope.blog = data.response.posts;</code></pre>\n<p><strong>page.html:</strong><br /></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;div ng-repeat=\"blog in blog | limitTo : 4\"&gt; /* grab up to 4 blog entries and repeat the data*/<br />{{blog.title}} /* so this returns data.response.posts.title */<br />&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"Messing around with the Tumblr API","date":"December 17, 2014","tags":["angular","api","code"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"blog/2014/12-17-messing-around-with-the-tumblr-api/","date":"2014-12-17T16:46:30.000Z"}}}
